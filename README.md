# CC: World Admin

Hello! This is the repository for my ComputerCraft: Tweaked project, World Admin. This project is a monitoring and management tool for your energy storage and factory monitoring needs. 

## Disclaimer
This project is still in its early stages of development. As such, it is not recommended to use this in any environmennt. As of now only a part of the UI is working as a proof of concept and some utilities are set up, but not fully implemented.

We'll see how this goes! It may be a while before this project is fully functional, but what you gonna do? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Dependencies:

- ComputerCraft: Tweaked (Forge: 1.20.1)
- UI Framework: [Basalt](https://github.com/Pyroxenium/Basalt)

## Notes:
- Here's my rough plan for this project: [Vision](VISION.md)
