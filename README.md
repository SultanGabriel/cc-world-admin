# CC: World Admin

This is the repository for my ComputerCraft: Tweaked project(s), which all are supposed to be connected to a central node for monitoring and stuff. This project is a monitoring and management tool for `stuff` (Silly Trash Unhelpful F***ing F\*\*k.). Why am I doing this? I'm just having fun.

## Disclaimer
Don't try this at home!

## Dependencies:

- ComputerCraft: Tweaked (Forge: 1.20.1)
- UI Framework: [Basalt](https://github.com/Pyroxenium/Basalt)

#### Branches
 - 'main': main branch
 - 'side': GregAdmin before it got merged
 - 'old': WorldAdmin before being overwritten by 'side', which was TankMonitor Project

If you are wondering, yes this is a mess, but it's just a fun side project.
